# Battle Assistant

## Summary
This is a project using Microsofts WinUI3 framework to create a application that supports the Combat Mission games play by email system. This is achieved by automating the process of moving files from the incoming email foldera and outgoing email folder of a combat mission game and the shared drive of the opponent. This project took inspiration from Combat Mission Helper in what initial features to add.

## Features
- A modern nice looking UI
- The main automation loop for file moving
- Auto clean folders as battle progresses
- Clean all folders when battle has ended
- The ability to manage mulitple battles with multiple opponents in multiple combat mission games

## Why this project was made
This project was mainly made for my own benefit as I wanted an excuse to learn C# and how to make a modern desktop application. I choose this specific idea as Combat Mission Helper isn't being developed anymore and I thought there were areas that could be improved upon.
